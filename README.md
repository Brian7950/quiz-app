## About Quiz app
### quiz app uses DOM objects to influence what user sees and interacts with page. 

### Some challanges I ran into where 
#### Grasping **event** in DOM. 
### Understanding nested arrays in objects and how to call on them. 
### Saving to localStorage on and event such as clicking a button. 

## Future implementation 
### Add additonal questions
### Randomize order in which questions are asked as well as order in which options are displayed. 
### Add additional highschore at end of quiz with multiple scores and names saved and displayed.
